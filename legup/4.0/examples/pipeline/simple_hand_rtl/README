pipeline.v is the hand-written verilog pipeline for ../pipeline.c:
    #define N 4
    int a[N] = {1,2,3,4};
    int b[N] = {5,6,7,8};
    int c[N] = {0};
    for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
    }

Note that the altsyncrams have an output register - so they have a latency of 2, to match LegUp

To simulate in modelsim run:
    make v
To see the waveforms run:
    make w
