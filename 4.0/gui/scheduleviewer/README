1. Install Qt:
on Ubuntu (tested):
sudo apt-get install libqt4-dev

2. Build the project
cd gui/scheduleviewer
qmake (this will generate the makefile)
make (this will build the project)

3. Run the program
./scheduleviewer <scheduling report>

To run program with a pipeline schedule:
./scheduleviewr <scheduling report> -p <pipeline schedule report>

The pipeline schedule report must comes with a scheduling report.
You can navigate to a loop by clicking on the "start_<loop name>" basic block
on the Explorer panel


To enable call graphs and control flow graph support:

1. install graphviz:

   wget http://www.graphviz.org/pub/graphviz/ARCHIVE/graphviz-2.26.3.tar.gz

   the latest version is graphviz-2.30, but both 2.28 and 2.30 have some bugs

   after unzip and untar the file, go into the folder and type:

   ./configure
   make
   sudo make install

   This  will install graphviz library files in /usr/local or /usr

2. Enable graphs in scheduleviewer.pro

   In the legup/gui/scheduleviewer project folder, open scheduleviewer.pro
   add display_graphs (or uncomment it if it's already there) after CONFIG+=

3. make the project

   run under the project folder:

   qmake
   make clean
   make
