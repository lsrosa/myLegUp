To generate CHStone-like C file (test.c)
	perl test.pl <signature file> <# of test cases>

To generate C file with main with random inputs
	perl genInput <signature file> <# of test cases>

test.data is used for signature file in examples.


Signature file
	Format: <input type 1>--<input type 2>--.....<input type N>--<function name>--<output type>

	Supports: 	Signed, Unsigned
			short, int, long, long long
			character, string (character array)
			arrays


	Options:	Arrays (Fixed size)
			Specified by ":".
			Ex. if the input is array of 10 integers, it will be "int:10"

			Strings (char* type, length must be specified)
			Specified by ":"
			Ex. string of length 10 will be "char:10"

			Input range
			Range of the randomly input can be specified by using "<".  
			If not used, limit specified at the top of genInput.pl will be used.
			Ex1. "int<100" will randomly generate number between -100 to 100 for the variable.
			Ex2. "unsigned int<100" will randomly generate number between 0 to 100 for the variable.

			Constant Input
			Input can be fixed to a constant by using "=".
			Ex. "int=10" will always have 10 as the value of the variable.

			Array and range or constant can be used at the same time, but array specification must come first.
			Ex1. "int:10<50" Array of 10 integers with all values between -50 and 50
			Ex2. "int:3=10" Array of 3 integers with all values as 10.


	Restrictions:	Output must be numeric, returned by the function.
			Arrays must be fixed size
			"unsigned" must come first in data type
