This is the MIPSLoad program which is used to load programs on the
processor system and run them.  To build it run the build script.
MIPSLoad takes 2 required arguments, an executable name, and the
address of the MIPS Communication Server (usually localhost) and 1
option argument -r, giving that argument will cause the program to
start running after it is loaded, without the -r argument after
loading it stays in the debug stub so the debugger can be used.

So you will run MIPSLoad something like: MIPSLoad prog.elf localhost
or MIPSLoad prog.elf localhost -r

MIPSLoad sets the stack pointer to 0x01000000, if you don't use the
normal setup with 8mb SDRAM located at 0x800000 then you may wish to
change this (this will also need changing in the debugging stub).
