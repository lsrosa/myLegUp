1. For a caller function, make the callee's start, arguments output reg ports
make the callee's finish, return_val signals input ports

2. Strip out all module instantiations, and instantiate them at top-level
Create all necessary wires and connections between callers/callees

3. In each caller function, in the call state that connects caller's 
memory controller signals to callee's, remove all those since they will
be connected at the top-level. However make sure that there is at least 
one if assignment, such as 
if (cur_state==LEGUP_0)
    memory_controller_address_a = 0;
otherwise, without any if statement, the signal will be undefined.
